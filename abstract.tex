Project \projectname{} is a distributed storage and serving system inspired from Amazon's Dynamo. This paper presents a novel read-only data storage pipeline which fits into \projectname{} and leverages the inherent fault tolerance and scalability of the Dynamo architecture. The read-only data generation is done offline using MapReduce, thereby bridging the gap between batch oriented computation and serving systems. Most current serving systems fail to consume this massive data-set without affecting serving performance. As a production system at \linkedin{}, \projectname{} has successfully solved this problem and currently serves multiple TBs of new refreshed data every day. This has helped us iterate fast and build various new data-intensive social products.
